# Distance.WhatSongIsPlaying
Don't you hate going all the way into the audio menu just to check what current song is playing in custom music?
Wouldn't you love it if Distance could display what song is playing in game?
Now you can!

What this adds:

- Replace the timer text on the car screen with custom song info.
- Replace the speedrun timer text with custom song info.
- You can make it use the Album Artist metadata tag instead of the Artist metadata tag

The mod can't do anything if your files lack metadata!
